                    <p>Hello! My name is João Castro. I’m a game designer with 4+ years of professional experience, currently crafting experiences for thousands of players in the biggest Minecraft network of Brazil. Scrolling below you can see some examples of how i go about designing systems and solving problems. I hope you like it!</p>

                    <h1>Chance of Return</h1>
                    <h2>Raid mechanic</h2>

                    <div class="article-content">

                                <br>We were facing two big problems in our Factions servers. The first problem was that the Factions would most likely quit after being raided. The second problem was that some Factions would just explode their own base, just to not let their opponents grab their items.
                                <br>
                                <br>To give context: the most valuable items in the server were blocks that spawned monsters. You could steal those blocks from other Factions by raiding them, and exploding those blocks. When one of this blocks got exploded, there was a 60% chance of it dropping, and a 40% chance of it just disappearing (this acted as a money sink). If you destroyed your own Mob Spawning block, it would always disappear.
                                <br>
                                <br>We considered implementing a insurance system for the players to get back their spawners in case they were raided, but didnt end up using it. Since it would be possible to opt out of the system, some players cerainly would just lose their blocks in raids, and be frustrated for not having saved some money or activated the insurance.
                                <br>
                                <br>Eventually we came up with a great solution that solved both problems. Now, when a block is exploded by an opponent, it has a 55% chance of dropping, a 20% chance of disappearing, and a <b>25% chance of returning</b> to its original owners. This made so that it wasnt worth it to explode your own items anymore, since by doing it they would always disappear. This also made it almost impossible for players to lose all of their blocks in a raid, making them more likely to keep playing the game.

                    <h1>Lost Fortress</h1>
                    <h2>In-game event</h2>

                                This was an in-game event made for an MMO server. Our main objective with this was to create a point of massive PvP in the world.
                            <br>
                            <br>Every few days a fortress would spawn in a random location, and inside of it the players could find  a variety of rare items. In order to get inside the fortress, the players had to explode its walls using TNTs and other explosives.
                            <br>
                            <br>Multiple guilds would try to get into the fortress as fast as possible, and they also would also try to sabotage other guilds, making so that the players would have to defend their attack structures in other to get inside of the fortress successfuly.
                            <br>
                            <br>In order to support different playstyles during the raid (like sneak invading or fake invading), we made the fortress very big in size, but that decision led us to some challenges.
                            <br>
                            <br>Because of the size of the fortress, we had to create a dedicated world for the event, since in the default world it was almost impossible to place it without destroying player buildings. We also had to tweak the travel distance of the TNTs in that world, so that they could reach the deepest layers of the fortress.
                            <br>
                            <br>In the design process we also had to make sure that the rewards found inside the fortress would be worth the time and resources put into the raid.
