                    <h1>Lost Fortress</h1>
                    <h2>In-game event</h2>

                                This was an in-game event made for an MMO server. Our main objective with this was to create a point of massive PvP in the world.
                            <br>
                            <br>Every few days a fortress would spawn in a random location, and inside of it the players could find  a variety of rare items. In order to get inside the fortress, the players had to explode its walls using TNTs and other explosives.
                            <br>
                            <br>Multiple guilds would try to get into the fortress as fast as possible, and they also would also try to sabotage other guilds, making so that the players would have to defend their attack structures in other to get inside of the fortress successfuly.
                            <br>
                            <br>In order to support different playstyles during the raid (like sneak invading or fake invading), we made the fortress very big in size, but that decision led us to some challenges.
                            <br>
                            <br>Because of the size of the fortress, we had to create a dedicated world for the event, since in the default world it was almost impossible to place it without destroying player buildings. We also had to tweak the travel distance of the TNTs in that world, so that they could reach the deepest layers of the fortress.
                            <br>
                            <br>In the design process we also had to make sure that the rewards found inside the fortress would be worth the time and resources put into the raid.
